# contributing!
- the font used is similar to this? http://www.ccfonts.com/cinecav-mono/
- begin the caption with an indication of tone, for example: ```[ MENACINGLY ]```
- name the image after the text in the caption, such as: ```letschat.jpg```

# other stuff!
cats can't spell. terrible spelling/grammar is welcome and it adds to the charm.
